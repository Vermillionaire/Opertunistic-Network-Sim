The enviroment is a area with multiple different cell phones trying to connect to each other through wifi. As time goes on, nodes will connect and disconnect to each other form ing small networks that will pass message to eachother that they get from others. As this happens, messages should spead to all nodes in a viral manner.

Here is a Photo of all posible connections in the form of a graph

Each node has a connection radius. Any node within the radius, or if it is within someone elses raduis, can be connected to. The graph was built from these.
